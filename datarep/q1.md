Data representation question
============================
1a. If possible, create a struct with a total size of 24 bytes where 9 of the 24 bytes are padding. 

1b. Suppose struct x has components of the following types declared in the following order: 2 ints, 1 short, 1 char*, 3 unsigned chars.
    Suppose struct y has components of the following types declared in the following order: 1 int, 1 struct x, 5 chars.
    What is the size of struct y and how many bytes of padding does it have?
    
1c. What is the size of an array that holds 15 elements where each element is a const char*? How many bytes of padding will the array include?

1d. Suppose struct h has the following components: 3 ints, 2 longs, 3 shorts, 1 int*, 3 unsigned chars.
    What order should the components be declared in struct h in order to minimize the size of struct h? What is this minimum possible size of h with the following components? How     many bytes of padding will be included?

1e. Suppose struct f has the following components: 2 short*, 2 ints, 2 short, 1 long, 3 chars.
    If possible, give 1 order the components can be declared in so that struct f has at least 60 bytes. If possible, how many bytes of padding will be included. If not possible,       explain why you think so.
